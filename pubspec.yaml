  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
     - assets/images/
     - assets/json/


  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
     - family: Montserrat
       fonts:
         - asset: assets/fonts/Montserrat-Regular.ttf
           weight: 400
         - asset: assets/fonts/Montserrat-Medium.ttf
           weight: 500
         - asset: assets/fonts/Montserrat-Bold.ttf
           weight: 700
     - family: Alexandria
       fonts:
         - asset: assets/fonts/Alexandria-Regular.ttf
           weight: 400
         - asset: assets/fonts/Alexandria-Medium.ttf
           weight: 500
         - asset: assets/fonts/Alexandria-Bold.ttf
           weight: 700
